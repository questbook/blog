We are delighted to announce Questbook is now the official Grants and Bounty partner for *Klaytn*! _All_ the grants and bounties from Klaytn ecosystem will now be disbursed via Questbook. Klaytn has a large grant program. Notably, helping Opensea [get off the ground](https://dappradar.com/blog/klaytn-2-0-to-boost-efforts-on-global-ecosystem-expansion) in the early days. 

Klaytn and Questbook join hands to find and fund the next Opensea!

# What this means for the community
## Single Home
All the grants and bounties from across Klaytn will all be accessible in one place - on the [Klaytn page on Questbook](#coming-soon)

## Transparency & accountability
The applicants will know exactly what is the status of their application. Everything will be open and _on-chain_. You can view the [dashboards here](#coming-soon) in real time.

## Faster turn around times
Questbook gives super-powers to the people running the grants & bounty program. The process will be more streamlined and applicants will hear back about the next steps sooner. 

# Coming soon : Decentralized grants & bounties program
We at Questbook are committed to help Klaytn progressively decentralize the entire grants & bounty program. Initially, the program will be run by members of the Klaytn Foundation, and a few hand picked members of the community. 

However, we will actively be working towards enabling [_delegated domain allocators_](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/), where we will be involving the community more in the process of disbursing capital. 

# What can you do now
## Start working on the bounties

## Contribute to helping the process improve
Questbook is open sourced and an evolving standard for running a grant & bounty program. All the decisions are made through discussions that happen in the open on our discourse. You can participate in helping improve the process.

## Contribute to code
