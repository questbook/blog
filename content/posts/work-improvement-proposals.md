We're committed to making _permissionless work_ a reality to help millions of builders and contributors increase their economic mobility.

The Questbook team has been working with the top DAOs and protocols to fine tune the process and deployed the first version of the workflow tool. But there's a lot of work to be done. We need your help.

There are a few broad directions we're actively working on 

# Delegated domain allocation
## Problems
- A single capital allocation (grants/bounties/investments) program has numerous blind spots and will miss lot of opportunities
- A single capital allocation program will result in burn-out of the folks running them
- Voting on all grant and bounties is an unreasonable ask from the community, and inefficient for the community
## Solution space
- Multiple domain allocators - who run capital allocation programs in their domain of expertise
- All the domain allocators have full ownership of how to run the program, no community voting on every decision
- Full transparency of performance and direction, community members can initiate a no-confidence motion upon poor performance

# Work flow
## Problems
- Using multiple tools from Notion, Airtable to Google Docs to run a capital allocation program makes the process inefficient
- All tools used are centralized, no transparency and accountability on where an application is in the process

## Solution space
- Integrated tool including oppurtinity creation, accepting applications, tracking milestones, community based review, disbursal of capital
- Completely on chain for complete transparency & accountability 
- Composable for people to build workflow customizations and data analytics tools
