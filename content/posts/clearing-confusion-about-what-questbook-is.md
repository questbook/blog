This is a relevant time to clear some confusion around what we do at [Questbook](https://questbook.xyz)

People know us for our educational content.

We're in the business of helping builders increase financial mobility.

This is the time to focus on builders and building, now that the dust around NFTs and DeFi hype has settled. 

Our tutorials went viral, largely because there were no good crypto tutorials back when we launched in 2021. It resides on http://learn.questbook.xyz. We created that content because there is a huge earning potential for builders who know to build in web3.

The question soon became, what next? What to do after learning how to build. Many folks suggested (and some assumed) us to be a hiring platform for web3 companies. But that defeats the purpose of our endeavour. If we help devs get hired, we're just moving them from one payroll to another. Not interesting. Can we do more?

We want to empower builders to take their financial destiny into their own hands. That is the best way to give financial freedom to builders. When there is freedom, innovation happens.

Building, for the best builders, is like practicing art. Pushing the boundaries of what is possible, for the sake of pushing the boundaries.

When that happens, we learn about the problems we can solve using the technology we invented.

In web3, innovation has an added advantage. You don't have to reinvent wheels. Composability is at the heart of building in web3.

We are building infrastructure for permissionless work.

Uber drivers can start earning on tap of a button.
The best of the best developers can't start earning on the tap of a button.

That is the future we're building towards.

We are starting with an on chain grants tool. Full transparency in grants accessible to all builders across the web3 ecosystems.

http://questbook.xyz and [@questbookapp](https://twitter.com/questbookapp) is the space you want to watch as a builder.
